# Rod Calculation

This program solves rod tension/compression problems.

The program calculates tension and compression for a rod consisting of several segments.
For each segment, you must specify the height, cross-sectional area, and force at the end of the segment.
Based on the calculation results, images are created and saved to a file:
- schematic representation of the rod
- longitudinal force diagram
- stress diagram
- elongation diagram
